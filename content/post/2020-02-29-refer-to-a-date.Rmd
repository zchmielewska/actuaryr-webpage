# Installation

The functions described in this post are included in the `actuaryr` package.

```{r}
library("actuaryr")
```

# Date reference functions

## Purpose

First and last days of months, quarters and years are of special meaning 
for business reporting.

The business reports are usually created for the last day of some period,
like a month or a year.
They enclose data for the first day of this period up to the last.
If you create your report in the middle of the period, 
you may need to quickly refer to these dates.

The `dref_` prefix stands for **d**ate **ref**erence functions. 
The functions with the `dref_` prefix return a reference date to the base date.

## Functions

The functions work for three types of periods:

* a month
* a quarter
* a year

The functions return one of the four types of reference dates:

* the first day
* the first working day
* the last day
* the last working day

The names of functions combine the `dref_` prefix and the first letters 
of the chosen reference date.

For example, `dref_fdoy()` returns the **f**irst **d**ay **o**f a **y**ear.

The table below summarizes all date reference functions.

|                   | of month       | of quarter     | of year        |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| first day         | `dref_fdom()`  | `dref_fdoq()`  | `dref_fdoy()`  |
| first working day | `dref_fwdom()` | `dref_fwdoq()` | `dref_fwdoy()` |
| last day          | `dref_ldom()`  | `dref_ldoq()`  | `dref_ldoy()`  |
| last working day  | `dref_lwdom()` | `dref_lwdoq()` | `dref_lwdoy()` |

All functions take the argument `date`, which is the base date.
The functions return the result relative to the base date.
The functions always work within a specific period: a month, a quarter 
or a year.

### Monthly periods

The reference dates in the image below can be retrieved 
with the following functions:

* `dref_fdom()` - dark blue
* `dref_fwdom()` - light blue
* `dref_ldom()` - dark green
* `dref_lwdom()` - light green

The base date has been marked with orange.

```{r}
dref_fdom("2020-02-14")
dref_fwdom("2020-02-14")
dref_ldom("2020-02-14")
dref_lwdom("2020-02-14")
```

### Quarterly periods

The reference dates in the image below can be retrieved 
with the following functions:

* `dref_fdoq()` - dark blue
* `dref_fwdoq()` - light blue
* `dref_ldoq()` - dark green
* `dref_lwdoq()` - light green

The base date has been marked with orange.

**Watch out!** 
The first day of a year is the same as the first working day of a year. 
The last day of a year is the same as the last working day of a year.
Hence, the same day is marked with two colours (darker and lighter).

```{r}
dref_fdoq("2020-05-24")
dref_fwdoq("2020-05-24")
dref_ldoq("2020-05-24")
dref_lwdoq("2020-05-24")
```

### Yearly periods

The reference dates in the image below can be retrieved 
with the following functions:

* `dref_fdoy()` - dark blue
* `dref_fwdoy()` - light blue
* `dref_ldoy()` - dark green
* `dref_lwdoy()` - light green

The base date has been marked with orange.

**Watch out!** 
The first day of a year is the same as the first working day of a year. 
The last day of a year is the same as the last working day of a year.
Hence, the same day is marked with two colours (darker and lighter).

dref_ldoy("2020-09-21")
