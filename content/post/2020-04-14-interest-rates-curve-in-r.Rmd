Money changes its value in time. 10 euros today is not the same 10 euros in a year.
Interest rates imply **how** the money changes its value over time.

Sometimes it is reffered to an interest rate as a single number, like 2% per year. 
This implies that our EUR 10 will be EUR 10.20 after a year, 
EUR 10.40 after two years, EUR 10.61 etc.

However, interest rates also vary in time, so it's possible that the interest
rates will amount to 2% in the first year and 1.8% in the second year.
That's why we talk about interest rates curves. The curve here implies that 
it may change over time.

# Components

The `ircurve` is a class that represents the interest rates curve.
There are three components of an interest rate curve:

* rates
* type 
* period

We've already discussed  the interest **rates**. These are the actual rates, 
like 2% or 1.8%. 

The **type** implies the way of accretion. 
There are two main types of interest rates: *forward* and *spot*.

The *forward* rates allow us to move from one point in time to the other
period by period.

To calculate the value of money after 3 periods, use (1+f1)(1+f2)(1+f3).

The *spot* rates allow us to move from the begining to the point in time 
in one step.

To calculate the value of money after 3 periods, use (1+s3)^3.

The **period** implies the timespan for which the interst rate should be used.
It's most common to model cash flows for a *month* or a *year*.

# Usage

To create an interest rates curve in R, you can use `as_ircurve()`.

```{r}
rates <- c(0.018, 0.02)
my_ircurve <- as_ircurve(rates, type = "forward", period = "year")
```

This creates an interest rates curve with forward rates per year.
The rate for the first year is 1.8% and the rate for the second year is 2.0%.

```{r}
print(my_ircurve)
```
