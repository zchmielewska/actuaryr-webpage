The process of life insurance actuarial reporting consists of several steps.
Overall, the process can be divided into:

1. Preparation of policy data
1. Assumptions setting
1. Liability valuation
1. Reporting

Preparation of policy data, assumptions settings and reporting is currently 
computed with Excel. 
For the liability valuation, usually the specialized software such as Prophet
or RAFM is used.

In my opinion R is better for all areas currently dominated by Excel 
and worse than the specialized software for liabilities' valuation.
