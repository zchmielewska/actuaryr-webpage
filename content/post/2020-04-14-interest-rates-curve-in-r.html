<p>Money changes its value in time. 10 euros today is not the same 10 euros in a year.
Interest rates imply <strong>how</strong> the money changes its value over time.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is reffered to an interest rate as a single number, like 2% per year.
This implies that our EUR 10 will be EUR 10.20 after a year,
EUR 10.40 after two years, EUR 10.61 etc.</p>
<p>However, interest rates also vary in time, so it’s possible that the interest
rates will amount to 2% in the first year and 1.8% in the second year.
That’s why we talk about interest rates curves. The curve here implies that
it may change over time.</p>
<div id="components" class="section level1">
<h1>Components</h1>
<p>The <code>ircurve</code> is a class that represents the interest rates curve.
There are three components of an interest rate curve:</p>
<ul>
<li>rates</li>
<li>type</li>
<li>period</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve already discussed the interest <strong>rates</strong>. These are the actual rates,
like 2% or 1.8%.</p>
<p>The <strong>type</strong> implies the way of accretion.
There are two main types of interest rates: <em>forward</em> and <em>spot</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>forward</em> rates allow us to move from one point in time to the other
period by period.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-04-14-interest-rates-curve-in-r_files/ircurve1.png" /></p>
<p>To calculate the value of money after 3 periods, use (1+f1)(1+f2)(1+f3).</p>
<p>The <em>spot</em> rates allow us to move from the begining to the point in time
in one step.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-04-14-interest-rates-curve-in-r_files/ircurve2.png" /></p>
<p>To calculate the value of money after 3 periods, use (1+s3)^3.</p>
<p>The <strong>period</strong> implies the timespan for which the interst rate should be used.
It’s most common to model cash flows for a <em>month</em> or a <em>year</em>.</p>

<div id="usage" class="section level1">
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>To create an interest rates curve in R, you can use <code>as_ircurve()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rates &lt;- c(0.018, 0.02)
my_ircurve &lt;- as_ircurve(rates, type = &quot;forward&quot;, period = &quot;year&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This creates an interest rates curve with forward rates per year.
The rate for the first year is 1.8% and the rate for the second year is 2.0%.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>print(my_ircurve)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Interest rate curve
## Type:   forward 
## Period: year 
## Rates:
## [1] 0.018 0.020</code></pre>
</div>
