# Usage

The functions return the last day of the previous month, quarter or year.
These functions might be of use if you are preparing, for example, 
the results for the first quarter of 2020 (Q1 2020) and want to compare them
against the year-end results (YE 2019).

You can load the package with:

```{r}
library("actuaryr")
```


The functions are:

* `dref_mtd()` - returns month-to-date
* `dref_qtd()` - returns quarter-to-date
* `dref_ytd()` - returns year-to-date

`dref_mtd()`, `dref_qtd()` and `dref_ytd()` always return the last day 
of the preceding time period (rather than the last working day).

In the images below, the base dates have been marked with orange 
and the reference dates have been marked with green.

## Month-to-date

```{r}
dref_mtd("2020-02-14")
```
