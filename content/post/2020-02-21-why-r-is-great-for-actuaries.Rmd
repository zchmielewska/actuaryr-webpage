# The actuarial reporting process

The process of life insurance actuarial reporting consists of several steps.
Various IT tools are used in different areas.

The actuarial reporting process can be divided into the following areas:

For **valuation models**, specialized software is used, such as Prophet or RAFM.
I don't think R can easily replace them. 
Valuation models consist of a vast amount of variables that interact with each other. 
It's not comfortable to work with a big amount of interrelated variables in R. 
The mentioned software has been designed for one thing and one thing only - 
the development of valuation models. 
It requires the models to have a predefined, rigorous structure
but also allows easy maintenance. However, R is for sure much cheaper!

For all other areas - policy data, assumptions, reporting and communication - 
R is great!

# What are R's strengths in actuarial reporting?

* **R doesn't allow for sweeping stuff under the rug.**
In Excel, you can easily have one formula for all rows except this one row where you had to change something by hand. R is more strict and all manual adjustments are obvious.

* **R requires tables to be tables.** In Excel, you can have some text in first rows, then a header, then maybe another and finally some values. In R, tables must be tables.

* **R allows for proper version control.**
R is a code so can be used along with version control tools such as git. 
Using a version control tool means 
the knowledge what changes were made in each version, who made these changes 
and the possibility to revert to previous versions of the model.

* **R makes data wrangling easy.**
I remember struggling to pivot longer a table in Excel. 
Thanks to tidyverse and other packages, data manipulation in R is easy and elegant. 
New packages get developed every day thanks to the vibrant R community.

* **R supports reproducible and effective communication.**
With Rmarkdown, the production of financial reports can be easily automated. 
With ggplot2 and Shiny apps the results can be effectively passed on 
to a wider audience.

# What are R's weaknesses in the actuarial reporting?

* **R is not as popular as Excel.**
Many people know how to use Excel. 
Excel is used by actuaries as well as other professionals 
such as financial analysts and accountants.
R is not as popular as Excel so requires additional training for employees.

* **R is not a commercial product.**
Excel's commercial character indicates the accountability of the creators
for how it operates. R is open-source. 
Packages are created by individuals for you to use. 
However, you can not blame them if something goes wrong.

I see a great potential of using R in the actuarial reporting.
I hope that more and more insurance companies will use R!
