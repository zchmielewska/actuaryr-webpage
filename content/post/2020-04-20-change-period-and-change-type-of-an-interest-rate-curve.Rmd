# Change type of an interest rates curve

The two common types of interest rates curve are **forward** and **spot**.

With forward rates, we move along the timeline period by period.
With spot rates, we jump directly from the beginning to the given period.

Imagine an interest rates curve with yearly rates: 1.8%, 2%, 2.2%.

```{r}
irc_forward <- as_ircurve(rates = c(0.018, 0.02, 0.022), type = "forward")
print(irc_forward)
```

The value of 100 after 3 years amounts to:

```{r}
100*prod(1+irc_forward)
```

The forward rates can be changed to spot rates with `change_type()`.

```{r}
irc_spot <- change_type(irc_forward, to = "spot")
```
