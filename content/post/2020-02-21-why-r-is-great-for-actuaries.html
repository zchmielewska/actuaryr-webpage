<h1>The actuarial reporting process</h1>
<p>The process of life insurance actuarial reporting consists of several steps.
There are different IT tools in different areas.</p>
<p>The actuarial reporting process can be divided into the following areas:</p>

<p>For <strong>valuation models</strong>, specialized software is used, such as Prophet or RAFM.
I don’t think R can easily replace them.
Valuation models consist of a vast amount of variables that interact with each other.
It’s not comfortable to work with a big amount of interrelated variables in R.
The mentioned software has been designed for one thing and one thing only -
the development of valuation models.
It requires the models to have a predefined, rigorous structure
but also allows easy maintenance. However, R is for sure much cheaper!</p>
<p>For all other areas - policy data, assumptions, reporting and communication -
R is great!</p>

<div id="what-are-rs-strengths-in-actuarial-reporting" class="section level1">
<h1>What are R’s strengths in actuarial reporting?</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R doesn’t allow for sweeping stuff under the rug.</strong>
In Excel, you can easily have one formula for all rows except this one row where you had to change something by hand. R is more strict and all manual adjustments are obvious.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R requires tables to be tables.</strong> In Excel, you can have some text in first rows, then a header, then maybe another and finally some values. In R, tables must be tables.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R allows for proper version control.</strong>
R is a code so can be used along with version control tools such as git.
Using a version control tool means
the knowledge what changes were made in each version, who made these changes
and the possibility to revert to previous versions of the model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R makes data wrangling easy.</strong>
I remember struggling to pivot longer a table in Excel.
Thanks to tidyverse and other packages, data manipulation in R is easy and elegant.
New packages get developed every day thanks to the vibrant R community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R supports reproducible and effective communication.</strong>
With Rmarkdown, the production of financial reports can be easily automated.
With ggplot2 and Shiny apps the results can be effectively passed on
to a wider audience.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="what-are-rs-weaknesses-in-the-actuarial-reporting" class="section level1">
<h1>What are R’s weaknesses in the actuarial reporting?</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R is not as popular as Excel.</strong>
Many people know how to use Excel.
Excel is used by actuaries as well as other professionals
such as financial analysts and accountants.
R is not as popular as Excel so requires additional training for employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R is not a commercial product.</strong>
Excel’s commercial character indicates the accountability of the creators
for how it operates. R is open-source.
Packages are created by individuals for you to use.
However, you can not blame them if something goes wrong.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I see a great potential of using R in the actuarial reporting.
I hope that more and more insurance companies will use R!</p>
