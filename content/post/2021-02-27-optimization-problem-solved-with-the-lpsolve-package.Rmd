The `lpSolve` package is an excellent tool for optimization problems. 

In this post, we will use `lpSolve::lp()` to find an optimal friend.

# The problem

Imagine four people: Alice, Ben, Charlie and Donna. 

The values in the matrix below reflect how alike they are on a scale from 1 to 10.

```{r}

participants <- c("Alice", "Ben", "Charlie", "Donna")

n = length(participants)

data = c(10, 7, 8, 2, 
         7, 10, 3, 4,
         8, 3, 10, 6,
         2, 4, 6, 10)

scores_matrix <- matrix(data = data, nrow = n, dimnames = list(participants, participants))

print(scores_matrix)

```

For example, Alice and Charlie have a lot in common, so their score is 8. 
The score of Charlie and Ben is only 3 because they don't share many interests. 

Our goal is to connect these 4 people into pairs, in a way that the total score is maximal.

We could start with matching Alice with Charlie because their score is the highest (8 points). 
Then we need to match Ben with Donna who have 4 points.
The total score would be *12* points.

However, there is a solution that gains a better score. 
If we connect Alice with Ben (7 points) and Charlie with Donna (6 points), the total score is *13* points.

How to find the best matches mathematically?

# Optimization

## Objective

Let's notice that the scores' matrix is symmetrical. The score of Alice and Charlie is the same as the score of Charlie and Alice.

Values on the diagonal are all 10's because people know themselves the best. However, we want to connect each person with somebody else, so we can ignore the diagonal.

The scores' matrix can be limited to either lower or upper triangular.

```{r}
lower_triangular <- lower.tri(scores_matrix, diag = FALSE)
objective_matrix <- scores_matrix * lower_triangular
objective_matrix
```

The objective function is a polynomial which coefficients are the scores.

We want to maximize the function:


$0 \cdot x_{11} + 0 \cdot x_{12} + 0 \cdot x_{13} + 0 \cdot x_{14} + 7 \cdot x_{21} + 0 \cdot x_{22} + 0 \cdot x_{23} + 0 \cdot x_{24} +$ $8 \cdot x_{31} + 3 \cdot x_{32} + 0 \cdot x_{33} + 0 \cdot x_{34} + 2 \cdot x_{41} + 4 \cdot x_{42} + 6 \cdot x_{43} + 0 \cdot x_{44}$

which reduces to: 

$7 \cdot x_{21} + 8 \cdot x_{31} + 3 \cdot x_{32} + 2 \cdot x_{41} + 4 \cdot x_{42} + 6 \cdot x_{43}$

If:

* $x_{rc} = 1$ there is a match between person in row $r$ and column $c$, 
* $x_{rc} = 0$ there is no match.

## Conditions

There are a few requirements that need to be met. These requirements imply optimization conditions.

Arguments of `lpSolve::lp()` are split into coefficients, directions and values on the right-hand side.

Let's initiate a list for each of these arguments:

```{r}
con_coeff <- list()
con_dir   <- list()
con_rhs   <- list()
```

### Requirement 1: Don't allow for pairs in the upper triangular

We have limited the scores' matrix to the lower triangular. 

Values of $x_{rc}$ in the upper triangular and on the diagonal don't impact the objective function. 

Let's ensure that they amount to zero, i.e. $x_{rc} = 0$ if $r \leq c$.

```{r}
for (r in 1:n) {
  for(c in 1:n) {
    if(r <= c) {
      m <- matrix(0, nrow = n, ncol = n)
      m[r, c] = 1
      
      con_no = length(con_coeff) + 1
      con_coeff[[con_no]] <- m
      con_dir[[con_no]] <- "=="
      con_rhs[[con_no]] <- 0
      
      cat(paste0("\nCondition ", con_no, " [dir: ", con_dir[[con_no]], " , rhs: ", con_rhs[[con_no]], " ]\n\n"))
      print(con_coeff[[con_no]])
    }
  }
}
```

### Requirement 2: Maximal numbers of pairs is $n/2$ (floored)

If there are $n$ participants, there should be $\frac{n}{2}$ matches (or $\frac{n-1}{2}$ if $n$ is odd).

This means that:
$x_{21} + x_{31} + x_{32} + x_{41} + x_{42} + x_{43} = 2$

The above formula can be computed as:
```{r}
con_no <- length(con_coeff) + 1

con_coeff[[con_no]] <- 1 * lower_triangular
con_dir[[con_no]]   <- "=="
con_rhs[[con_no]]   <- floor(n/2)

cat(paste0("Condition ", con_no, " [dir: ", con_dir[[con_no]], " , rhs: ", con_rhs[[con_no]], " ]\n\n"))
print(con_coeff[[con_no]])
```

  
### Requirement 3: Each person can have maximally one pair

If there is an even number of participants, each person will have a pair.
If there is an odd number of participants, one person will be left without a pair.

The requirement of having at least one pair means that:

* sum of each row must be lower or equal to $1$,
* sum of each column must be lower or equal to $1$.

As there are 4 rows and 4 columns, we have additional 8 conditions:

```{r}
# Rows
for(i in 1:n) {
  con_no <- length(con_coeff)+1
  con_coeff[[con_no]] <- matrix(c(rep(0, (i-1)*n), rep(1, i), rep(0, (n-i)*(n+1))), byrow = TRUE, nrow = n)
  con_dir[[con_no]] <- "<="
  con_rhs[[con_no]] <- 1
  
  cat(paste0("\nCondition ", con_no, " [dir: ", con_dir[[con_no]], " , rhs: ", con_rhs[[con_no]], " ]\n\n"))
  print(con_coeff[[con_no]])
}

# Columns
for(i in 1:n) {
  con_no <- length(con_coeff)+1
  con_coeff[[con_no]] <- matrix(c(rep(0, (n-i)*(n+1)), rep(1, i), rep(0, (i-1)*n)), nrow = n)
  con_dir[[con_no]] <- "<="
  con_rhs[[con_no]] <- 1
  
  cat(paste0("\nCondition ", con_no, " [dir: ", con_dir[[con_no]], " , rhs: ", con_rhs[[con_no]], " ]\n\n"))
  print(con_coeff[[con_no]])
}

```

### Requirement 4: Pairs should be mirrored

Within the lower triangular, $x_{rc} = x_{cr}$. This condition ensures that we match pairs in a mirrored way.

```{r}
for(i in 1:n) {
  m <- matrix(rep(0, n^2), nrow = n)
  m[i,] <- 1
  m[,i] <- 1
  m <- m * lower_triangular
  
  con_no <- length(con_coeff)+1
  con_coeff[[con_no]] <- m
  con_dir[[con_no]] <- "<="
  con_rhs[[con_no]] <- "1"
  
  cat(paste0("\nCondition ", con_no, " [dir: ", con_dir[[con_no]], " , rhs: ", con_rhs[[con_no]], " ]\n\n"))
  print(con_coeff[[con_no]])
}

```

## Optimization

Let's prepare arguments of the `lpSolve::lp()`.

```{r}
f.obj <- c(objective_matrix)
f.con <- do.call(rbind, lapply(con_coeff, c))
f.dir <- do.call(rbind, lapply(con_dir, c))
f.rhs <- do.call(rbind, lapply(con_rhs, c))
```

And now we can perform the optimization.

```{r}
result <- lpSolve::lp("max", f.obj, f.con, f.dir, f.rhs)
solution <- matrix(result$solution, nrow = n, dimnames = list(participants, participants))
solution
```

Awesome! Our algorithm has connected Alice with Ben and Charlie with Donna as expected!

We now know how to match people in pairs so that the population is as happy as possible.

An application of this algorithm has been used in an R Shiny app [Optimate](https://zchmielewska.shinyapps.io/optimate/). Take a look!

Have fun optimizing!
